#Group members should download hate_crimes.csv to their own machines and alter the argument to the open_csv("file_path") function with the correct file path they set up. 

## Some note about how to use github

If you want to use github to manage this R project, the easiest way is to get VSCode working, and install git, r on your local machine and VSCode.

To finish all installing steps, refer to: 
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github
and
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r

After install, you can do:

> git clone https://github.com/kegzfitz/STAT240.git

to get a local repository, and edit the file on the machine.

After edit everything, do:

> git add .

> git commit -m "Comments that you want to left for this submission"

> git push

and the update will be shown on the remote repository on Github webpage.

## If that's too complicated:

Just download all files and copy/paste your updating using 'edit' on the Github website will also solve it.
